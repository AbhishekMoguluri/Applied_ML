The goal is to consolidate your understanding of various Python concepts such as functions, lists, dictionaries, loops, and control structures. The system will allow users to add books and list all the books in the library.\n","\n","#### Features\n","1. **Add Book**: Users can add a new book to the library, specifying the title and author. Each book will have an automatically generated unique ID and a status indicating whether it is available.\n","\n","2. **List Books**: Users can view a list of all the books in the library, including their IDs, titles, authors, and availability status.\n","\n","#### System Structure\n","The system will consist of the following components:\n","- A global list `books` to store the details of each book (list of dictionary of books). Each element in a list is a dictionary. For example,  `[{'id': book_id, 'title': title, 'author': author, 'available': available}]`.\n","- Functions to handle the features (add book, list books).\n","- A main menu function to navigate through the options.\n","\n","#### Step-by-Step Guide\n","1. **Create the 'add_book' Function**:\n","   - Parameters: `title` (string), `author` (string), `available` (boolean, default True).\n","   - Functionality: Generate a unique ID, create a dictionary with the book's details, append it to the `books` list.\n","   \n","\n","2. **Create the 'list_books' Function**:\n","   - Parameters: None.\n","   - Functionality: Iterate through the `books` list, print the details of each book.\n","  \n","\n","3. **Create the 'main_menu' Function**:\n","   - Parameters: None.\n","   - Functionality: Continuously display a menu with options to add a book, list books, or exit; take user input to select an option; call the relevant functions based on user input.\n","   \n","4. **Initialize the Books List**: Create an empty global list `books` to store the book details.\n","\n","5. **Test the System**: Call the `main_menu` function to run the system, test adding books, and listing them.\n","\n","#### Conclusion\n","This exercise provides an opportunity to apply various Python concepts in a practical context. Through hands-on coding and experimentation, you'll deepen your understanding of Python and its capabilities.
